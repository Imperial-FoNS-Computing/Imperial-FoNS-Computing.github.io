<p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language used in many modules
with a numerical computing component. There are several ways to install Python
on your computer, but most modules will assume that you are using the Anaconda
distribution, so that’s the one whose installation we primarily document here.
If you have another Python 3 distribution installed, then this is likely to
work, however your mechanism for installing additional Python packages may not
be the same as that documented in the lecture materials, so you may have to sort
that out for yourself.</p>
<div class="section" id="python-2-and-python-3">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Python 2 and Python 3<a class="headerlink" href="#python-2-and-python-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python has just completed a decade-long major version transition from Python 2
to Python 3. As of 1 January 2020 Python 2 is officially unsupported, even for
critical security updates. The instructions here are for the installation of
Python 3. Don’t try to use Python 2 for your work as it is unsupported and
increasingly likely to have breakages which won’t be fixed.</p>

<p>You can obtain Anaconda <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/">using the Anaconda Windows installation site</a>. Simply follow the
instructions there to download and run the installer.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.3.1. </span>Homebrew install Anaconda<a class="headerlink" href="#homebrew-install-anaconda" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you’ve installed <a class="reference internal" href="homebrew.html#homebrew"><span class="std std-ref">Homebrew for Mac</span></a> then you can install Anaconda by
to <a class="reference internal" href="terminal.html#terminal"><span class="std std-ref">opening a terminal</span></a> and run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> brew cask install anaconda
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When asked, enter your Mac password. On this occasion we’re not quite done
because Homebrew is quite conservative about installing a new Python over
another one you might have installed. We’re going to need to tell the terminal
that we want Anaconda to be our default Python.</p>
<p>The way we do this depends slightly on which command line program (or “shell”)
we are using. The default on recent MacOS is <strong class="command">zsh</strong>, but if you’ve been using
MacOS for a while and haven’t changed, you might be using <strong class="command">bash</strong>. Just to be on
the safe side, we’ll run both commands. If you know for sure which shell you are
using, then you can just run the appropriate one. If you’re not sure, run both:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:$PATH&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:$PATH&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then close the terminal and open a new one to make sure the changes have taken
effect. Run the following command to check that Anaconda is working properly:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> conda --version
<span class="go">conda 4.8.3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Don’t worry if the version you see installed is not the same as that listed here.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.3.2. </span>Download and install Anaconda<a class="headerlink" href="#download-and-install-anaconda" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can also install Anaconda on your Mac by downloading the Anaconda installer
and installing it yourself. This is documented on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/">the Anaconda MacOS
installation website</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.3.3. </span>Homebrew Python<a class="headerlink" href="#homebrew-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An alternative to using Anaconda is to install Python directly using
<a class="reference internal" href="homebrew.html#homebrew"><span class="std std-ref">Homebrew</span></a>. Simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> brew install python
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will automatically ensure that the command <strong class="command">python3</strong> points to the correct
Python installation, however the Python package installation mechanism won’t be
the Anaconda one. Instead you will use Python’s standard package installer
<strong class="command">pip</strong>. For example if you need to install <strong class="command">numpy</strong> and <strong class="command">matplotlib</strong> (the core
numerical computing and plotting packages), as well as support for Jupyter
notebook, you would run:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> pip3 install numpy matplotlib jupyter
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>MacOS also comes with Python pre-installed. However this is a very cut-down
version which is really only intended for internal use by the operating system.
You should install a fully-featured Python (i.e. Anaconda or Homebrew).</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>Installing Python on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every Linux distribution includes a fully-featured Python, and this might
well be enough for your needs. However if you would prefer to have the same
Python distribution as most of your classmates, then there are instructions for
installing Anaconda on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/">the Anaconda Linux install website</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-python-packages-on-linux">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Installing Python packages on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python-packages-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you’re using the system-installed Python, as opposed to Anaconda, then you
should use the Python package manager <strong class="command">pip</strong> to install any additional packages
that you need. There are a couple of issues with this of which you should be
aware. First, not all Linux distributions install <strong class="command">pip</strong> by default, often you
need to install an additional package called something like <strong class="command">python-pip</strong>. For
example, on Ubuntu you would run:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install python3-pip
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you already have python 2.x and then installed python3, your pip will by default be pointing to python3’s pip. you can verify that by typing <strong class="command">pip --version</strong> which would be the same as <strong class="command">pip3 --version</strong>.</p>
<p>While on Fedora and related distributions, you would run:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo dnf install python-pip
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s also possible to install quite a lot of Python packages using the Linux
package manager in a similar way. However, you will probably want to install at
least some packages using pip. For example if you wanted to install Jupyter you
would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> pip3 install --user jupyter
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <strong class="command">--user</strong> option tells pip to just install for the current user. This is
preferable to using <strong class="command">sudo</strong> and to install packages globally, as it removes any
risk of interfering with packages that the operating system needs.</p>

<div class="section" id="python-virtual-environments">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.5. </span>Python Virtual Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#python-virtual-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we move on to actually installing packages, we need to give a
little thought to where the packages are to be installed. We could
simply install packages into the Python installation on our
computer. This can be a reasonable approach if all you want to do is
run code from the default versions of public packages. However, it has
a number of limitations. Basically, a Python installation is a single
namespace for packages, so if two different projects you are
working on need two different versions of the same package, you’re out
of luck. Similarly, if you are working on changes to a package, you
probably don’t want your half-finished experimental work to be the
package that your other projects use.</p>
<p>Python virtual environments, or venvs, are separate namespaces within
a Python installation. They have their own Python command and
collection of packages. Effectively they behave like their own
separate Python installation, except that most of the core Python
files are shared, so a venv takes rather little additional space.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-venv">
<span id="create-venv"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.5.1. </span>Creating a venv<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-venv" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most straightforward way to create a venv is on the terminal
command line, not from within Python itself. This is accomplished
using Python’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv" title="(in Python v3.9)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code></a> package. For example, to create a venv
called <strong class="command">my_venv</strong>, you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> python3 -m venv my_venv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Don’t forget that the <strong class="command">$</strong> stands for the command prompt: you don’t
type it. This command will create the folder <strong class="command">my_venv</strong> and various
subfolders containing things like the Python program itself and space
for any packages which you install in the venv. If there was already a
file or folder called <strong class="command">my_venv</strong> in the current folder then you’ll get
an error, so make sure you choose a new name.</p>
<p>A venv doesn’t usually contain any particularly valuable data, so you
should regard them as essentially disposable. In particular, if
something goes wrong when creating a venv, just delete it and start
again. In the bash or zsh shells you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> rm -rf my_venv
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><strong class="command">rm -rf</strong> will delete its argument and all its subdirectories
without further prompts or warnings. There is no undo operation.
Be very careful about what you delete.</p>
</div>

<span id="activate-venv"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.5.2. </span>Using a venv<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-venv" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you run Python from the terminal, then the simplest way to use the
venv is to source its activate script. If using bash or zsh on Mac or
Linux you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">source</span> my_venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>while using bash on Windows you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">source</span> my_venv/Scripts/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, you would use the folder name of your venv instead of
<strong class="command">my_venv</strong>. In either case, your command prompt will change to indicate
that you are now using the venv. It might look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(my_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any subsequent invocations of Python commands such as <strong class="command">python3</strong> will
now use the version from the venv, with access to whatever packages
you have installed in that venv. If you are using a terminal shell
other than bash or zsh, then see the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv" title="(in Python v3.9)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code></a> package documentation
for the correct activation command.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Venv activation is just for one terminal session. You need to
activate the venv every time you open a new terminal.  If you find
that Python can’t find your packages or tests, then the first thing
to check is whether you remembered to activate the venv.</p>

<p>When the venv is active, the <strong class="command">pip3</strong> that your terminal will find is the one from
the venv, and any packages you install will be installed in the venv, not in the
system Python installation. For example if you needed Numpy and Matplotlib, you
would type the following in the <a class="reference internal" href="terminal.html#terminal"><span class="std std-ref">terminal</span></a>:</p>

<p>In order to do the coursework for a typical module using Python, you’ll want to
have a venv for the module, so that packages and software you use in different
modules don’t interfere with each other, and you’ll usually want to have one
folder for each assignment that is set in the module. If the module is using
<a class="reference internal" href="git.html#github-classroom-exercise"><span class="std std-ref">GitHub Classroom</span></a> then each of these exercise folders
will be a git repository.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we are taking a module called Principles of Programming. We
would use a folder structure like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>principles_of_programming
├── PoP_venv
├── exercise_1
├── exercise_2
├── exercise_3
└── ...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s see how we would set this up. First, <a class="reference internal" href="terminal.html#terminal"><span class="std std-ref">open a terminal</span></a>.
You can also do several of these steps graphically, but the precise steps are
harder to explain, and are different on different operating systems.</p>
<p>The terminal will usually open in your home folder. Maybe you want to put the module
folder straight in your home folder, or maybe you want to put it somewhere else.
This just comes down to how you organise the files on your computer. On my
computer, I like to keep this sort of folder in a documents folder called <strong class="command">doc</strong>.
So I need to switch into that folder first with the <strong class="command">cd</strong> (change directory)
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> doc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we create the main module folder using <strong class="command">mkdir</strong> (make directory):</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> mkdir principles_of_programming
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Avoid spaces in names</p>
<p>Even though spaces are usually allowed in file and folder names, many
software packages contain bugs which cause them to fail to handle spaces in
names correctly. It’s therefore good practice not to have spaces in file or
folder names.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we change into the folder we just created:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> principles_of_programming
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Use tab completion</p>
<p>Most modern terminals (or, rather, the shell program inside) support tab
completion. This means that you can press the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">tab</kbd> key to have the terminal
complete command and file names. In this example, rather that typing out
<strong class="command">principles_of_programming</strong>, you can type <strong class="command">pr</strong> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">tab</kbd> and, so long as this is
the only name in the current folder starting with <strong class="command">pr</strong>, the shell will
insert the rest of the name. If there are more names starting with <strong class="command">pr</strong> then
you may have to type more characters before tab completion will work.</p>
<p>Tab completion is often preferable to typing because it’s not only faster
but avoids typos.</p>
</div>
<p>Next we <a class="reference internal" href="#create-venv"><span class="std std-ref">create the venv</span></a>. We could call it anything we like,
but we would probably like a name which is short (because it’s going to appear
at the start of every line in the terminal), describes which venv this is, and
says that it’s a venv. In this case, the name <strong class="command">PoP_venv</strong> will do nicely:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> python3 -m venv PoP_venv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When that completes, we’ll need to <a class="reference internal" href="#activate-venv"><span class="std std-ref">activate the venv</span></a>. On Windows we would
type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">source</span> PoP_venv/Scripts/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While on Mac or Linux it would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">source</span> PoP_venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next we’ll install whichever Python packages we need for the module. Let’s
suppose we just need Jupyter:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> pip3 install jupyter
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, we’ll need to create the folder for the first exercise on our module.
If the module is not using GitHub Classroom then you’ll just use <strong class="command">mkdir</strong> to make a
folder for each exercise. However for GitHub Classroom modules there will be a
Git repository to clone for each exercise. As a demonstration, we can use this
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/imperiallearn/exercise_1">example Git repository</a>. Unlike
most coursework repositories, this one is public so anyone can clone it.
Assuming we’ve <a class="reference internal" href="git.html#git-windows"><span class="std std-ref">installed Git</span></a>, we can type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git clone https://github.com/imperiallearn/exercise_1.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If we now examine the contents of the current folder with <strong class="command">ls</strong> (list) then we
can see that we have the venv folder and the exercise folder as expected:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> ls
<span class="go">exercise_1  PoP_venv</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <strong class="command">exercise_1</strong> repository contains a simple “Hello World” program written as
both a Python file and a Jupyter notebook. For example we can run the file
version thus:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> python3 exercise_1/hello.py
<span class="go">Hello World!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or we can launch the Jupyter version:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> exercise_1
<span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> jupyter notebook hello.ipynb
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This pops up a web browser showing:</p>

that is in the folder you open, which is one of the reasons for our folder
layout. The other important feature is the green triangle at the top right.
Clicking on this will open a terminal and run this code:</p>
<img alt="_images/vscode_hello_py_output.png" src="_images/vscode_hello_py_output.png" />
<p>Looking at the bottom left, we can see that Visual Studio Code has opened a
terminal, activated the virtual environment, and then run Python on our file
<strong class="command">hello.py</strong>. The result is the text <strong class="command">Hello World!</strong> printed out.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.7.3. </span>Opening a Jupyter notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-a-jupyter-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If we instead click on <strong class="command">hello.ipynb</strong> then this Jupyter notebook will open. You
might be asked whether to trust the notebook, and you should agree. The result
will be something like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/vscode_hello_ipynb.png" src="_images/vscode_hello_ipynb.png" />
<p>If you’re used to Jupyter notebooks opening in your web browser, then this may
look a bit strange, but it’s actually just the same interface, albeit in
slightly unfamiliar colours. Clicking on the green triangle, or clicking in the
code box and pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">enter</kbd> will run the code:</p>
